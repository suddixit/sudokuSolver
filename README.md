# Sudoku Solver

> A simple sudoku solver I learnt from [computerphile on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM).

## Description

There are two files in this repo. The sudoku.py is the complete example I learnt on computerphile. The sudokuSolver.py is encapsulated in a class which finds and stores all the solutions to the sudoku problem posted. You can import the class to create instances and use or you can directly call the methods.

Please look at exampleRun.py to understand how to use the class version of Sudoku Solver.
